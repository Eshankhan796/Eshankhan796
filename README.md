## Myself
Hi, I'm Eshan Khan, and I'm from Bangladesh. I'm a teen. I'm a student. I'm a hobby programmer. I love to code. I do web app building, web development, hacking, photo editing, video editing, graphic design, etc. I'm a self-taught programmer. You know self-taught programmers are smart. I learned programming and designing by myself, from YouTube, and from developers like you. I enjoy coding. I want to destroy. I mean, I want to build my career in programming. I also like cybersecurity. I want to build my own technology company in the future. I'm still learning. There is a saying, "no pain, no gain." I have to learn it, even if it's hard for me.

## My works
I have done some programming work, and I'm still doing it. I would like to share it with you. Open source and contributions are a must for future tech.

## Education 

I don't like studying much, but they will judge you by your academic knowledge and not by your real skills.
